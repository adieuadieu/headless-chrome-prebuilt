# headless-chrome-prebuilt
Prebuilt binaries of the Chromium/Chrome [headless shell](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/headless/app/headless_shell.cc) for convenient use of Headless Chrome in node.js land. Yay.

## Limitations / Known Issues
- binaries are prebuilt which means you trust that I didn't insert any malicious code into the chrome binaries.
- Building the chrome binary requires accepting the EULA for fonts. By using this package, you agree to also accept the EULA for fonts.
